Explain how to use a specific pattern for game development.

## When the user asks about a pattern:

1. Explain what the pattern is

3. Provide engine-agnostic pseudocode
4. Discuss trade-offs
5. Give real game examples

## Output Format

```markdown
# Pattern: [Name]

## What It Is
[2-3 sentences explaining the core concept]

## When to Use in Games
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]
- [Use case 3]

## When NOT to Use

- [Anti-pattern 2]

## Implementation

### Core Structure
```pseudo
// Engine-agnostic pseudocode
class [PatternName] {
    // Key elements

// Specific game example
```

## Trade-offs

### Pros
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]

### Cons
- [Disadvantage 1]
- [Disadvantage 2]

## Real-World Examples
