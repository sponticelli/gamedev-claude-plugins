# Core Loop Analysis

Evaluate a game's core loop for design health.

## Process

1. Identify the core loop from user description
2. Analyze each component
3. Assess loop sustainability
4. Provide improvement recommendations

## Output Format

```markdown
## Core Loop Analysis: [Game/Feature]

### The Loop
```
[Goal] → [Action] → [Reward] → [Investment] → (repeat)
```

### Component Health

#### Goal Clarity
**Rating:** [Strong/Adequate/Weak]
- Is the goal always visible? [Yes/No]

- Is it achievable? [Yes/Sometimes/Rarely]
**Notes:** [Specific observations]

#### Action Engagement

**Rating:** [Strong/Adequate/Weak]
- Does player invest back into the loop? [Yes/Somewhat/No]
- Does investment create ownership? [Yes/Somewhat/No]
- Does investment improve future loops? [Yes/Somewhat/No]
**Notes:** [Specific observations]

### Loop Sustainability

**Repetition Tolerance:** [High/Medium/Low]
How many times can this loop repeat before fatigue?

**Variation Points:** [List]
Where does the loop vary to stay fresh?

**Exit Points:** [List]
Where can players naturally stop?

### Diagnosis
[Overall assessment of loop health]

### Recommendations
