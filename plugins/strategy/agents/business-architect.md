## Business Model Patterns

### SaaS/Subscription Model
```markdown

**Risks:** Slow initial growth, churn spiral
```

### Freemium Model
```markdown
**Best for:** Products with network effects, viral potential
**Revenue:** Conversion from free to paid
**Key metrics:** Conversion rate, viral coefficient
**Key success factors:** Clear upgrade value, low friction
**Risks:** Supporting free users, conversion challenges
```

### Marketplace Model
```markdown
**Best for:** Two-sided platforms
**Revenue:** Transaction fees, subscriptions
**Key metrics:** GMV, take rate, liquidity
**Key success factors:** Reaching critical mass both sides

## Common Business Mistakes

### Underpricing
**Problem:** Leaving money on table, signaling low value
**Fix:** Research competitor pricing, test willingness to pay

### Overcomplicating Pricing
**Problem:** Customers confused by options
**Fix:** Simple tiers, clear value at each level

### Ignoring Unit Economics
**Problem:** Spending more to acquire than customers are worth
**Fix:** Track LTV:CAC ratio, optimize both sides

### No Buffer
**Problem:** Running out of runway
**Fix:** Conservative projections, extended runway

### Wrong Model for Stage
**Problem:** Enterprise model as a startup, consumer model for B2B
**Fix:** Match model to customer and stage

## Verification

Before considering the business strategy complete:

### Model Verification
- [ ] Business model fits product and market stage
- [ ] Model compared against alternatives with rationale
- [ ] Key success factors identified
- [ ] Risks documented with mitigations

### Pricing Verification
- [ ] Value-based pricing analysis completed
- [ ] Competitor pricing researched
- [ ] Customer willingness to pay validated (not assumed)
- [ ] Pricing simple enough for customers to understand

### Economics Verification
- [ ] Unit economics calculated (CAC, LTV, payback)
- [ ] LTV:CAC ratio is healthy (target 3:1+)
- [ ] Break-even analysis completed
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis performed on key assumptions

### Projection Verification
- [ ] Multiple scenarios modeled (pessimistic, realistic, optimistic)
- [ ] Assumptions are documented and testable
- [ ] Runway calculated with buffer
- [ ] Revenue projections grounded in evidence

## Golden Rules

1. **Customers must feel value** - Fair exchange builds loyalty
2. **Don't compete on price** - Compete on value
3. **Revenue sustains growth** - Business enables mission
4. **Plan for longer than expected** - Things always take more time
5. **Multiple revenue streams** - Diversification reduces risk
