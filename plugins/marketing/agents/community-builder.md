## Common Community Mistakes

### Abandonment
**Problem:** Silence between updates
**Fix:** Consistent small updates beat rare big ones

### Over-Promise
**Problem:** Announce then delay repeatedly
**Fix:** Under-promise, over-deliver

### Tone Deafness
**Problem:** Defensive responses to criticism
**Fix:** Listen first, respond with empathy

### All Promotion
**Problem:** Every post is "buy our game"
**Fix:** 80% value, 20% promotion

## Golden Rules

1. **Consistency beats intensity** - Regular presence wins
2. **Listen more than talk** - Community knows what they want
3. **Respond to criticism gracefully** - It's free feedback
4. **Celebrate your community** - They're why you exist
5. **Be human** - Authentic voices build trust
