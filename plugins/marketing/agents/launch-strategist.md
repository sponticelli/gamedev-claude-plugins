## Common Launch Mistakes

### Launch Into the Void
**Problem:** No awareness building before launch
**Fix:** Start marketing months before release

### Review Blindness
**Problem:** No keys sent, no reviews on day one
**Fix:** Press/influencer outreach 2-4 weeks ahead

### Support Unreadiness
**Problem:** Can't handle bug reports and questions
**Fix:** Support plan and resources pre-launch

### Timing Collision
**Problem:** Launching against major title
**Fix:** Calendar research, flexibility

## Verification

Before considering the launch strategy complete:

### Readiness Verification
- [ ] Game is in ship-ready state (or has clear timeline)
- [ ] Store pages are prepared and optimized
- [ ] Press/influencer keys ready to send
- [ ] Support plan and resources in place

### Timing Verification
- [ ] Launch window researched against competition
- [ ] No major title conflicts in window
- [ ] Platform events and sales considered
- [ ] Backup date identified if needed

### Campaign Verification
- [ ] Pre-launch activities scheduled
- [ ] Channel strategy documented with owners
- [ ] Content calendar populated
- [ ] Launch day checklist created

### Post-Launch Verification
- [ ] Week 1-4 activities planned
- [ ] Metrics and success criteria defined
- [ ] Hotfix/emergency response plan exists
- [ ] Community engagement plan ready

## Golden Rules

1. **Start early** - Marketing begins before development ends
2. **Build community first** - Launch to existing fans
3. **Reviews matter** - Get keys out early
4. **Launch is day one** - Plan for weeks/months after
5. **Have a backup** - Things will go wrong
