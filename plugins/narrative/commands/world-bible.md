# World Bible Generator

Create a foundational world-building document.

## Context Gathering

Before generating the world bible, understand the project:

### Analyze the Game
- What genre is the game?
- What's the core fantasy or power fantasy?
- What themes should the world support?
- What's the tone (dark, whimsical, epic, etc.)?

### Understand Scope Needs
- How much world is actually visible in the game?
- What aspects matter for gameplay?
- What needs to be detailed vs. implied?
- Is this for a single game or franchise?

### Check Existing Material
- Is there existing lore to incorporate?
- Are there character or location concepts?
- What art direction exists?
- What's already been communicated to the team?

### Identify Constraints
- Setting constraints (time period, tech level, magic)?
- IP requirements or restrictions?
- Cultural sensitivity considerations?
- Platform or rating considerations?

Use this context to create appropriate world-building.
