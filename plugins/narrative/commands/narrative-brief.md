## Context Gathering

Before generating the narrative brief, understand the project:

### Analyze the Game
- What genre and setting?
- What's the core gameplay loop?
- What's the target audience?
- What's the tone and mood?

### Understand Narrative Scope
- Is story central or supplementary?
- How is narrative delivered? (Cutscenes, dialogue, environmental)
- What's the player's role in the narrative?
- How much content is needed?

### Check Existing Direction
- Is there existing lore or world-building?
- Are there established characters?
- What themes are already defined?
- What's been written already?

### Identify Constraints
- Budget for narrative content?
- Voice acting planned?
- Localization scope?
- Platform limitations?

Use this context to create focused narrative direction.
