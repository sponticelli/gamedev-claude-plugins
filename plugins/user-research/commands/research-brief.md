## Context Gathering

Before creating the research brief, understand the research need:

### Identify the Trigger
- What prompted this research need?
- What decision is blocked without data?
- What assumptions need validation?
- What's the urgency level?

### Define Scope
- What specific aspects need research?
- What's in scope vs. out of scope?
- What do we already know?
- What gaps exist in current knowledge?

### Understand Stakeholders
- Who needs these insights?
- What format do they prefer?
- When do they need results?
- How will results be used?

### Check Resources
- What methods are available?
- What budget exists?
- What timeline is realistic?
- What expertise is needed?

Use this context to create a focused research brief.
