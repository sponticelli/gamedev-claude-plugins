# First Principles Thinking

Strip away assumptions to find fundamental truths, then build solutions from the ground up.

## Why It Works

Most thinking is by analogy: "This is like that, so do what worked before." First principles asks: "What's actually true here?" This is how breakthrough innovation happens.

## Process

1. Identify the problem and conventional approach
2. List all assumptions embedded in that approach
3. Question each assumption ruthlessly
4. Identify what's fundamentally, unavoidably true
5. Build a new solution from those fundamentals

## Output Format

```markdown
## First Principles: [Problem]

### The Conventional Approach
[How this is usually solved]

### Embedded Assumptions
| Assumption | Why We Assume This | Actually True? |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| [Assumption 1] | [Origin of belief] | [Yes/No/Partially] |
| [Assumption 2] | [Origin of belief] | [Yes/No/Partially] |
| [Assumption 3] | [Origin of belief] | [Yes/No/Partially] |
| [Assumption 4] | [Origin of belief] | [Yes/No/Partially] |
| [Assumption 5] | [Origin of belief] | [Yes/No/Partially] |

### Fundamental Truths
What remains after stripping away assumptions:
- [Undeniable truth 1]
- [Undeniable truth 2]
- [Undeniable truth 3]

### Physical/Logical Constraints
- [Hard constraint 1]
- [Hard constraint 2]

### Rebuilding from Fundamentals

**Given these truths, what's actually possible?**
[New approach built from fundamentals]

**Why this is different:**
[How it breaks from conventional thinking]

### The Insight
[The key realization from this analysis]
```

## Example: Elon Musk on Batteries

**Conventional:** "Batteries cost $600/kWh, that's just what they cost."

**First Principles:**
- What are batteries made of? (Cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers, steel)
- What do those materials cost on the London Metal Exchange? (~$80/kWh)
- Why the gap? (Manufacturing process, supplier margins, industry structure)
- Can we change those factors? (Yes—vertical integration, new processes)

**Result:** Tesla's battery cost trajectory

## Questioning Prompts

- "Why does it have to be this way?"
- "What if we started from scratch?"
- "What's the physics/logic here?"
- "Who says this is a rule?"
- "What would a Martian think about this?"
