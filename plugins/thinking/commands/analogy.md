# Analogy Mining

Find proven solutions in distant domains and translate them to your context.

## Core Insight

Most "new" ideas are old ideas from somewhere else. The further the source domain, the more novel the result.

## Process

1. Abstract the problem (remove domain-specific words)
2. Ask "Where else does this pattern exist?"
3. Study how that domain solves it
4. Translate the solution back to your context

## Output Format

```markdown
## Analogy Mining: [Problem]

### Abstract Pattern
**Specific problem:** [The challenge as stated]
**Abstract pattern:** [The underlying question without domain-specific words]

### Domain Explorations

#### Domain 1: [Distant Field]
**How they solve it:** [Their approach]
**Key principles:** [What makes it work]
**Translated to your context:** [How this applies]

#### Domain 2: [Another Field]
**How they solve it:** [Their approach]
**Key principles:** [What makes it work]
**Translated to your context:** [How this applies]

#### Domain 3: [Another Field]
**How they solve it:** [Their approach]
**Key principles:** [What makes it work]
**Translated to your context:** [How this applies]

### Best Translation
**From:** [Domain]
**Principle:** [Core insight]
**Applied:** [Specific implementation for your situation]

### Why This Works
[Why the analogy holds]

## Abstraction Examples

| Specific Problem | Abstract Pattern | Distant Domains |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| "How to onboard new users" | "Transfer complex skills gradually" | Music lessons, martial arts, cooking |
| "How to retain daily users" | "Create habitual behavior" | Coffee rituals, exercise, religion |
| "How to handle support volume" | "Scale expertise efficiently" | Libraries, hospitals, call centers |
| "How to price a new product" | "Signal value appropriately" | Art galleries, restaurants, consulting |

## Domain Sources

- **For processes**: Manufacturing, nature, sports
- **For retention**: Habits, rituals, relationships
- **For growth**: Ecosystems, networks, movements
- **For pricing**: Auctions, subscriptions, freemium models
- **For quality**: Craftsmanship, medicine, aviation
