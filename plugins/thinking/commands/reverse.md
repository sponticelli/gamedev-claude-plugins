# Assumption Reversal

You've been asked to apply the assumption reversal technique. This is one of the most powerful lateral thinking tools.

## Process

1. **Identify the challenge** from user input
2. **List 5-7 hidden assumptions** people make about this challenge
3. **Reverse each assumption**
4. **Explore what becomes possible** with each reversal
5. **Find the actionable insight**

## Output Format

```markdown
## Assumption Reversal: [Challenge]

### Hidden Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Reversal | What Becomes Possible |
|---|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | [Assumption] | [Opposite] | [New possibility] |
| 2 | [Assumption] | [Opposite] | [New possibility] |
| 3 | [Assumption] | [Opposite] | [New possibility] |
| 4 | [Assumption] | [Opposite] | [New possibility] |
| 5 | [Assumption] | [Opposite] | [New possibility] |

### Most Promising Reversal

**Assumption:** [The one with most potential]
**Reversal:** [The opposite]
**Concept:** [2-3 sentences on how this could work]
**First Step:** [Concrete action to explore this]
```

## Example

**Challenge:** "Meetings take too long and accomplish nothing"

| Assumption | Reversal | Possibility |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Meetings must have agendas | No agenda | Unstructured discussions surface unexpected insights |
| Everyone must attend | Almost no one attends | 2-person decisions with broadcast results |
| Meetings happen at set times | No scheduled meetings | On-demand sync when actually needed |
| Meetings require talking | Silent meetings | Write-first, then discuss (Amazon style) |
| Meetings are for discussion | Meetings are for decisions | No meeting without a decision to make |

Start immediately with the user's challenge.
