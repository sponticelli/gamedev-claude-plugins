# Random Stimulus Session

Break out of mental ruts by forcing connections with random inputs.

## Core Insight

Your brain follows established neural paths. Random input forces new connections that deliberate thinking can't reach.

## Process

1. Generate 3-5 random stimuli
2. Force connections with the problem (no "this doesn't apply")
3. Extract the interesting kernel from each
4. Develop the viable ideas

## Output Format

```markdown
## Random Stimulus Session: [Problem/Topic]

### The Challenge
[What we're ideating on]

### Stimulus 1: [Random Word/Concept]

**Forced Connections:**
- [Connection 1] → [What it suggests]
- [Connection 2] → [What it suggests]
- [Connection 3] → [What it suggests]

**Kernel:** [The interesting idea that emerges]

### Stimulus 2: [Random Word/Concept]
[Same structure]

### Stimulus 3: [Random Word/Concept]
[Same structure]

### Most Promising Ideas
1. [Idea] - [Why it's interesting]
2. [Idea] - [Why it's interesting]

### Next Step
[How to explore the best idea further]
```

## Stimulus Types to Try

- **Random word**: Force connect a noun to your problem
- **Random constraint**: "What if it had to be [instant / free / invisible / massive]?"
- **Random object**: Look at something nearby and connect it
- **Random combination**: "[Your field] + [unrelated concept]"
- **Random person**: "How would [historical figure / fictional character] approach this?"

## Rules

- No rejecting stimuli as "not applicable" - that's the point
- Quantity over quality during generation
- Separate generation from evaluation
- Try at least 3 stimuli before concluding

Generate random stimuli and apply to user's problem immediately.
