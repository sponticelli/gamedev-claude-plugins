# Rapid Brainstorm Session

You've been asked to run a rapid brainstorming session. Generate ideas quickly without judgment.

## Process

1. **Understand the topic** from the user's input
2. **Generate exactly 10 ideas** - varied, from safe to wild
3. **No filtering** - include obvious and crazy ideas
4. **One sentence each** - brevity forces clarity
5. **End with a wild card** - one idea that seems "too much"

## Output Format

```markdown
## Brainstorm: [Topic]

1. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
2. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
3. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
4. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
5. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
6. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
7. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
8. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
9. **[Idea Name]** - [One sentence description]
10. **[Wild Card]** - [The idea that seems too crazy but might be brilliant]

**Spark:** [Which idea excited you most as you generated these?]
```

## Guidelines

- Include at least 2 "safe" conventional ideas
- Include at least 2 ideas that subvert expectations
- Include at least 1 idea from a completely different field
- The wild card should make you slightly uncomfortable
- If an idea doesn't fit in one sentence, it's not clear enough

Start generating immediately based on the user's topic.
