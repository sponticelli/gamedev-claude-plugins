# What-If Exploration

You've been asked to explore "what if" scenarios. This technique pushes boundaries by imagining alternative realities.

## Process

1. **Take the user's premise** or generate one from their context
2. **Create 5 "what if" questions** of increasing boldness
3. **For each, explore implications** for their challenge
4. **Find connections** between the scenarios
5. **Identify the most promising direction**

## Output Format

```markdown
## What-If Exploration: [Context/Challenge]

### Scenario Ladder

#### What If Level 1: [Safe Variation]
**Scenario:** [Description]
**Impact:** [What changes]
**Example:** [Concrete implementation]

#### What If Level 2: [Moderate Change]
**Scenario:** [Description]
**Impact:** [What changes]
**Example:** [Concrete implementation]

#### What If Level 3: [Significant Shift]
**Scenario:** [Description]
**Impact:** [What changes]
**Example:** [Concrete implementation]

#### What If Level 4: [Industry Challenge]
**Scenario:** [Description]
**Impact:** [What changes]
**Example:** [Concrete implementation]

#### What If Level 5: [Paradigm Break]
**Scenario:** [Description]
**Impact:** [What changes]
**Example:** [Concrete implementation]

### Pattern Recognition
[What themes emerge across these scenarios?]

### Recommended Exploration
**Scenario:** [Which one to pursue]
**Why:** [Reasoning]
**First Experiment:** [How to test this cheaply]
```

## Example Starter "What Ifs"

- What if we had no budget constraints?
- What if we had to launch tomorrow?
- What if our main competitor did this first?
- What if we optimized for delight instead of efficiency?
- What if there were no rules or precedent?
- What if failure was impossible?
- What if our users became our team?

Apply to the user's context immediately.
