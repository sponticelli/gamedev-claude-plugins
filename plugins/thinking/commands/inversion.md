# Inversion

Instead of asking "How do I achieve X?", ask "What would guarantee I fail at X?" Then systematically avoid those things.

## Why It Works

- It's often easier to identify what causes failure than what causes success
- Avoiding stupidity is more reliable than seeking brilliance
- Negative knowledge (what NOT to do) compounds
- Charlie Munger: "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there"

## Process

1. State the goal clearly
2. Invert: What would guarantee failure?
3. List every way to fail
4. Invert back: What must we avoid/ensure?
5. Build strategy around avoidance

## Output Format

```markdown
## Inversion: [Goal]

### The Goal
[What success looks like]

### Inverted Question
"What would guarantee we FAIL at [goal]?"

### The Failure Recipe
To absolutely, certainly fail, we would:

1. **[Failure mode 1]**
   - How it causes failure: [Explanation]

2. **[Failure mode 2]**
   - How it causes failure: [Explanation]

3. **[Failure mode 3]**
   - How it causes failure: [Explanation]

4. **[Failure mode 4]**
   - How it causes failure: [Explanation]

5. **[Failure mode 5]**
   - How it causes failure: [Explanation]

6. **[Failure mode 6]**
   - How it causes failure: [Explanation]

### Inverting Back: The Success Requirements

| To Fail | To Succeed |
|---------|------------|
| [Failure 1] | [Avoid/opposite of 1] |
| [Failure 2] | [Avoid/opposite of 2] |
| [Failure 3] | [Avoid/opposite of 3] |
| [Failure 4] | [Avoid/opposite of 4] |
| [Failure 5] | [Avoid/opposite of 5] |
| [Failure 6] | [Avoid/opposite of 6] |

### The Non-Negotiables
Based on inversion, we MUST:
- [ ] [Critical requirement 1]
- [ ] [Critical requirement 2]
- [ ] [Critical requirement 3]

### Warning Signs
If we see these, we're heading toward failure:
- [Warning sign 1]
- [Warning sign 2]
- [Warning sign 3]

### The Insight
[What inversion revealed that forward-thinking missed]

## Classic Inversions

**Goal: Happy marriage**
- Inversion: How to guarantee divorce?
- Fail recipe: Be selfish, never communicate, hold grudges, take partner for granted
- Success: Be generous, communicate constantly, forgive quickly, show appreciation daily

**Goal: Successful career**
- Inversion: How to guarantee career failure?
- Fail recipe: Be unreliable, stop learning, burn bridges, blame others
- Success: Be dependable, keep learning, maintain relationships, take ownership

**Goal: Healthy life**
- Inversion: How to guarantee poor health?
- Fail recipe: Never exercise, eat junk, don't sleep, ignore stress
- Success: Move daily, eat real food, prioritize sleep, manage stress

## Inversion Prompts

- "What would make this impossible?"
- "How could we sabotage this?"
- "What do all failures have in common?"
- "What's the worst way to approach this?"
- "If an enemy wanted us to fail, what would they do?"
