# Perspective Shift

Escape your own viewpoint by deliberately adopting others. You are not your user.

## Process

1. Define the problem from your perspective
2. Select 4-5 different perspectives
3. For each: "How would [X] see this? What would they want?"
4. Note where perspectives conflict or align
5. Design for the conflicts
